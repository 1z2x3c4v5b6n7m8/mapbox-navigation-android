### About Mapbox Navigation SDK for Android

When your users want directions, donâ€™t push them out of your application into a generic map application; instead, keep them engaged with your application 100% of the time with in-app turn-by-turn navigation.

The Mapbox Navigation SDK is built on top of [our Directions API](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-java/blob/master/mapbox/libjava-services/src/main/java/com/mapbox/services/api/directions/v5/DirectionsService.java) and contains logic needed to get timed navigation instructions. We are designing new maps specifically for navigation that highlight traffic conditions and helpful landmarks. The calculations use the user's current location and compare it to the current route that the user's traversing to provide critical information at any given moment. _You control the entire experience, from the time your user chooses a destination to when they arrive._
